# Tipitaka Pali Reader

To get this working, you need to **download the database** from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VqUU-oeR2U8bBa1WQTdXhlcDM4FATIn5/view?usp=share_link

**Extract into the assets database folder, and then run the script to break it up.  The database will be deleted.  Make sure the zip file or complete unzipped db are not in the assets folder when making for release.. (it is big).**


A new Flutter project forked from Tipitaka Pali

Functional requirements.

Function Requirements Document (FRC)

The Tipitaka Pali Projector will be overhauled and rewritten with the tpp used as a functional requirement model and partial design.  Many things will be redesigned from the base upwards.  The new TPP will be referred to as TPP2 and perhaps renamed to TUPR


# Phase 1:  
Decide on a new name:  Tipitaka Pali Reader
Add all English TPP dictionary support and word break.
Refresh the Pali from cscd disk.  (I will get most up to date from Frank Snow)
Automate One Click refresh to db (any language is fine).
Add to Play store.

# Phase 2:  
Merge the two programs (Tipitaka Pali and TPP) for android ios
Research how to display in desktop with webview replacement
Normalize the data in the database

# Phase 3
Desktop + Mobile:  
Add multiview fo (M A T) similar and better than tipitaka.app and digitalpalireader.online
Research how to display in desktop without webview.  It does not look like anything is going to be written for desktop webview. 
Simple html widgets exist
Consider simplifying the html
Normalize the paragraphs by db instead of <div>
 
Normalize the data in the database


# Philosophy Issues agreed on:
Flutter as base language
Sqlite
Better Normalization
Philosophy Issues needed for working together:
 Page separation by MM pages
In phase II, we should have the ability to display the data in any separate method.  Ie. MM para num, PTS, MM Page, etc.  It needs to be thought out, however, for the history.
Continuous Scrolling books.  Sometimes, you just want to scroll to find something without using search methods.  This is part of TPP philosophy.
I was thinking of merging issue 1 with this.. We could have a vertical list with raised cards.  We could fill the individual cards by _getPaliByChosenSeparationMethod  -- or something like this.
Single Click / Tap word lookup.  
I believe this is important, but I am willing to sacrifice long press or double click for word selections.  There is a global gesture widget that can get any input.  This might be the prefered method.  There are widgets that exist with callbacks, some without .  This needs to be researched for Desktop Phase.
