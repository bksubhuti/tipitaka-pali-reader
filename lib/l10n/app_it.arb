  "about_info":             "We strive to make the best Pāḷi reading app ever made using with Flutter with a SQLite database.  TPR is available in Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. The Digital Pāḷi Dictionary is used for word splits, and ships with the DPD and DPD Grammar.  DPD was created by Ven Bodhirasa as Creative Commons license.  The ​DPD website is here:  https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/ .  We owe many thanks to this venerable because a good dictionary and splitter makes or breaks a good Pāḷi reader.  His work is ongoing and you can update with the updated extensions.   Most of the TPR code was written by Venerable Pandazza while I did most of the project management with some minor code additions and bug fixes.  Sumbodhi (Bulgaria) is our part time volunteer consultant who does various challenging tasks.  The PEU (Pāḷi English Ultimate) Is a translated version of the abbreviated Pāli Myanmar Abhidhān Dictionary.  This is an ongoing project translated by humans and Google.  There are 200,457 entries with 118,376 translated by humans.  It is quite useful to help you get the meaning of some difficult words not found in any other dictionary.  You can create issues and request features on the github website https://github.com/bksubhuti/tipitaka-pali-reader/issues , The Pāḷi is claimed to be copyright by VRI, The logo book is modified internet picture, Buddhaghosa or ajahn Jayaysaro youtube.  The Lao Font called LaoPaliRegular.ttf was created and copyrighted by Ven Jayasaro which was modified from a Google Font.  Both are free to use.
